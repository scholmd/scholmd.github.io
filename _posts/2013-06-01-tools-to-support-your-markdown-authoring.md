Markdown is automatically rendered to html GitHub but can easily be parsed into a variety of other formats including PDF and LaTex. To convert seamlessly to these formats, you'll need a document converter. [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is one such open source tool that is available on all platforms. You'll need to install a local copy to be able to run all the examples in this repo.<!--more-->
